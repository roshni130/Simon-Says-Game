I developed a game called "Simon Says." Here's how it works:

Game Start:
1.When the game begins, a random color flashes on the screen.
2.The player must press the corresponding key for the flashed color.

Level Progression:
1.If the player correctly presses the corresponding color key, they advance to the next level.
2.In each new level, an additional random color flashes on the screen.
3.The player must repeat the entire sequence of colors, including the new one, in the correct order.

Game Over:
1.If the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong key or the sequence incorrectly, the game is over.
2.The final score, which is the number of levels completed, is displayed.

Restart Option:
1.After the game ends, the player has the option to restart the game and try again.
